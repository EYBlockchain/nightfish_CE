This crypto library is based on the EspressoSystems [Jellyfish](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/jellyfish/tree/main/plonk) library but has additions and changes necessary for making it work with Nightfall_4; principally addition of Recursive Proving, Zeromorph, Inner Product Arguements and HyperPlonk. We are extremely grateful for EsspressoSystems work.

Please note that this software should be treated as experimental. It should not be used to make significant value transactions.

## Use
Although prinarily intended as a library that supports Nightfall_4, it can be used stand-alone and can be tested with `cargo test`
