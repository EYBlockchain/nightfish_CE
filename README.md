# nightfish_CE
This crypto library is based on the EspressoSystems [Jellyfish](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/jellyfish/tree/main/plonk) library but has additions and changes necessary for making it work with Nightfall_4; principally addition of Zeromorph, inner product arguements and Multilinear Extensions. We are extremely grateful for EsspressoSystems work.

Please note that this software has not yet been audited and should therefore be treated as experimental. It should not be used to make significant value transactions.

## Use
Although prinarily intended as a library that supports Nightfall_4, it can be used stand-alone and can be tested with `cargo test`
